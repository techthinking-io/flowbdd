 * Annotation for method validation.

 * The validation expression is a string that defines expected input-output relationships.
 * For example: "(5) = 10" means that when the method is called with the argument 5, it should return 10.
 * 
 * This annotation can be used with the ValidateRunner to automatically test methods against their validation expressions.
